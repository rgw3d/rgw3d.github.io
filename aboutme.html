	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/FirstnameLastname.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hi my name is Ada Lovelace and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from England.
	In high school, I ran track, competed with my robotics team, and often volunteered at my local library. 
	My hobbies include photography and gaming. Fun fact: I share my name with the world's first programmer.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigBot (an ACM special interest group for robotics), WCS (Women in Computer Science), and going on an ASB (Alternative Spring Break) Trip. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">résumé</a>!</p>
