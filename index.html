      </p>
      <p>I am a Computer Science major, EE minor at the University of Illinois.</p>
      <p>After I started college I quickly realized that while I really enjoy CS, I also really like circuits.</p>
      <p>What I like most is building the software and hardware interfaces to physical machines. </p>
      <p>Huge fan of anything space related.</p>
      <p>Ask me anything about Hyperloop.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
      <h3>Software Engineering Intern,<br>Ball Aerospace</h3>
        <p class="st dt">June &mdash; August 2018</p>
        <p>Developed algorithms for an image processing PCI card for a satellite. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Wrote C++ for an embedded PowerPC CPU running VxWorks to do image processing and tracking. Tested algorithms in MATLAB, porting to C++ and running unit tests to verify continuity</p></li>
        <li><p>Tracking algorithms contained several parts, including an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem" target="_blank">Assignment Algorithm</a>. I greatly improved the Assignment Algorithm speed through binning, and implementing a multiple pass filter.  </p></li>
        <li><p>In order to predict and propagate tracks between image frames, motion model filters were used. I performed through testing and profiling of a Kalman filter on the embedded platform, helping to redesign the model to improve its speed. </p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Led electronics design, integration, and testing for two payloads for <a href="http://www.ball.com/aerospace/about-ball-aerospace/careers/college-internships/birst">BIRST</a>, an intern program launching payloads on ULA's <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/explore/intern-rockets" target="_blank">Future Heavy</a> sounding rocket.</p>

      <h3>Software Engineering Intern,<br>Ball Aerospace</h3>
        <p class="st dt">June &mdash; August 2017</p>
        <p >Developing data collection, command and telemetry software as a part of a Flight Demonstration program.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Interfacing with a wide variety of COTS hardware. All of these pieces fit together in the data collection software &mdash; a multi-threaded C++ program running in a Linux environment.</p></li>
        <li><p>Experience using <a href="http://cosmosrb.com/" target="_blank" >COSMOS</a>, an open source command and telemetry interface that Ball Aerospace developed, written in Ruby.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Led sensor suite electronics development and testing for <a href="http://www.ball.com/aerospace/about-ball-aerospace/careers/college-internships/birst" target="_blank">BIRST</a>, an intern program launching payloads on <a href="http://www.eoss.org/" target="_blank">EOSS</a> high altitude balloons.</p>

        <p >I worked in the Collaboration Services area inside of Global IT, which is responsible for SharePoint, Skype, OneDrive for Business, and all of Office 365.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>
    To automate and simplify business processes, I implemented two SharePoint custom solutions. These solutions use the SharePoint Client API in both C# and JavaScript to modify files and lists.</p></li>

      <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <h3>Team Captain,<br>Illini Hyperloop</h3>
          <p class="st dt"><i>June 2017 &mdash; Present</i></p>
          <p><a href="https://illinihyperloop.com/">Illini Hyperloop</a> is a student organization competing in the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">SpaceX Hyperloop</a> Pod Competition. I have been involved with this project since October 2015, and have been the team captain since June 2017.</p> 
          <p>Currently the team is continuing development for a future competition.</p> 
          <p>From June 2016 to June 2017 I was the Electronics Lead of Illini Hyperloop during the first competition. After learning a lot from the first competition, I lead the design for all of the electronic subsystems on the second pod. Specifically developing a new PCB, battery system, power electronics, and additional AVR computing units. Also I documented a complete wire harness for the pod, detailing every wire and port.</p>
          <p>I am leading the development of the pod's embedded AVR boards, working in C. These boards are responsible for communicating with all onboard sensors, and controlling the brakes. I also contribute to the pod's flight software, and LabVIEW base station.</p>

        <h3>Custom controlled Quadcopter</h3>
          <p class="st dt">December 2015 &mdash; April 2017</p>
          <p><a href="https://youtu.be/vmumu3bHsCg" target="_blank">Video of test flight!</a></p>
          <p>Buying a quadcopter is just too easy. I wanted to build my own, so I did! During the winter break of my freshman year, I began to buy the parts and put together my quadcopter.</p>
          <p>However, the quadcopter is <i>not</i> controlled from a <a href="img/remote_control.jpg" target="_blank">traditional RC remote</a>. I have a different set up. I created an <a href="img/android_controller.png" target="_blank">Android app</a> that acts as a controller which communicates via Wi-Fi to a Raspberry Pi onboard of the quadcopter, which then relays the inputs via a serial port to the MultiWii flight controller. I was initially inspired by an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/" target="_blank">Instructable</a>, so I decided to document my build process as well.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi server - <a href="https://github.com/rgw3d/PiQuadcopter" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
            <li>Android remote controller - <a href="https://github.com/rgw3d/QuadcopterController" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
            <li>Multiwii Serial port communication implemented in C - <a href="https://github.com/rgw3d/cMultiWii" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pi-Quadcopter/" target="_blank">Instructable</a> tutorial detailing the entire build and setup process</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>National High School Game Academy,<br> Carnegie Mellon University</h3>
        <p class="st dt">June 2014 &mdash; August 2014</p>
        <p >NHSGA is a six week program that Carnegie Mellon University hosts. I was exposed to the artistic and technical side of the video game industry, creating video games with other programmers, artists, and game designers. I was able to work with two different teams as a lead programmer and create a total of three video games. I learned C# to be able to program the games using the Unity Game Engine. It was a great experience where I could focus all of my time and energy to develop great games.</p>
